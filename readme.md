This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for Borehole Temperature observations. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

The idea is that each record (feature) in an interchange document represents an individual observation. Thus there are multiple records if there are multiple observations in a single borehole, indexed by depth, procedure, time of observation properties. It’s a data access format, so this results in lots of duplication of the header/indexing information, but keeps life simpler for the client application. This becomes problematic in the continuum from single temperature measurements to a discrete log with measures every 100’ to a continuous temperature log; it’s sort of arbitrary when one switches from the individual temperature measure as being the observation to the ‘log view’ in which the series of measures is the observation result (currently represented as an excel spreadsheet or LAS file)—based mostly on what we think will be most useful to customers. 

Deployed services use the approved 1.5 schema. A 1.7 schema was suggested at GDSDPWG, but never implemented. Comments from that version were integrated into the 1.5 version, which still validates with previously deployed services. 2013-03-07
